# Micro Grid User Energy Planning Tool Library (MiGUEL)



## Introdcation

MiGUEL is a python-based, open-source simulation tool to design, simulate and evaluate the performance of photovoltaic-diesel-hybrid systems. MiGUEL is based on a matlab tool developed at the Technische Hochschule Köln (TH Köln). In the course of the research project Energy-Self-Sufficiency for Health Facilities in Ghana ([EnerSHelF](https://enershelf.de/)) the matlab tool was transferred to python, revised and additional components were added.  
MiGUEL aims to provide an easy-to-use simulation tool with low entry barriers and comprehensible results. Only a basic knowledge of the programming language is needed to use the tool. For the system design, simulation adn evaluation only a small number of parameters is needed. The simulation can run without data sets provided by the user. 
The results are provided in the form of csv files for each simulation step and in the form of an automatically generated pdf report. The csv files are understood as raw data for further processing. The pdf report serves as a project brochure. Here, the results are presented clearly and graphically, and an economic and ecological evaluation of the system is carried out.


## Authors and contributors
The main author is Paul Bohn (@pdb-94). Co-author of the project is Silvan Rummeny (TH Köln) who created the first approach within his PhD. Other contributors are Moritz End (TH Köln). Further assistence was provided by Sascha Birk (TH Köln).
