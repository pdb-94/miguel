The key parameter to evaluate energy systems on an economical basis are the LCOE. LCOE stands for Levelized Cost of Energy and is a metric used to compare the cost of energy produced by different sources. It represents the average cost of energy over the lifetime of a power generation project, including all costs such as capital costs, operating costs, fuel costs, CO2 costs and maintenance costs and revenues (e.g. through feed-in). The LCOE allows for a fair comparison of energy generation options, as it takes into account all costs and revenues over the lifetime of a project, rather than just the upfront capital costs. The LCOE is often used to compare different types of energy generation, including conventional fossil fuels and renewable energy sources, and is an important tool for energy planning and investment decisions.
