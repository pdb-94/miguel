The following report was automatically created using the Micro Grid User Energy Planning Tool Library (MiGUEL). MiGUEL was developed as part of the project 'Energy Supply for Healthcare Facilities in Ghana' (EnerSHelF) and will be published as an python-based open source planning tool to design and optimize Renewable Energy-Diesel-Hybrid systems. EnerSHelF was funded by the German Federal Ministry of Research and Development for the period from June 2019 to March 2023. EnerSHelF aims at improving the energy access and reliability of healthcare facilities in Ghana. The project's goal is to address the challenges faced by healthcare facilities in accessing reliable and sustainable energy sources by implementing a new reliable energy system. This will not only improve the energy efficiency of healthcare facilities but also support the delivery of quality healthcare services. The project will also raise awareness about the benefits of clean and sustainable energy sources and provide training and support to healthcare facility staff to ensure effective use and maintenance of the new energy solutions. EnerSHelF seeks to contribute to the improvement of healthcare in Ghana by ensuring healthcare facilities have access to reliable and sustainable energy sources.
